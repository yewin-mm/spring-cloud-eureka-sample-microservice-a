# spring-cloud-eureka-sample-microservice-a
* This is the sample microservice for Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka service A project.
* Eureka is for service discovery. Microservices (client) can register in Eureka Server and communicate each other through Eureka server by Service name.
* This project is communicate with [Eureka Server](https://github.com/yewin-mm/spring-cloud-eureka-server) for Service Registry <br> 
and communicate with [Microservice b](https://github.com/yewin-mm/spring-cloud-eureka-sample-microservice-b) and [Microservice b Instance 2](https://github.com/yewin-mm/spring-cloud-eureka-sample-microservice-b-instance2) as sample instance of Service B.

<a name="about-the-project"></a>
## ‚ö°Ô∏èAbout The Project
This is Demo Project for Spring boot with Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka as Service Discovery and communicate with other microservices.<br>
There are two types of service discovery, <br>
1. Client Side Service Discovery
2. Server Side Service Discovery

Eureka is for Client Side Service Discovery and the main advantages is Microservices can communicate well even without knowing ip address location.<br>
Because normally we need ip:port to call service. (Here, service means microservice) <Br>
* Let's say `Service A (producer)` call to `Service B (consumer)`.
* We need the `location (ip address:port)` of Service B to call from A.
* But here, Eureka Server provide for `registry` and for that case, Services need to register in Eureka Server.
* Eureka knew the register Service location and map as Service Name. <br> And Discovery Server is like database and storing Services location and querying Service location from it's database <br>
So that, Service A can call to Service B with `Service Name` and Eureka Server take that name and route to Service B location.
* So, Service A don't need to know for Service B location, and it's the one of the advantage of using Service Discovery. <br>
Because we might migrate Service B deployed Server and if we changed that the address (ip) will change also.
* If we used the direct calling way rather than using Service Discovery approach, we need to change the url in Service A when A call to Service B. 
<br> As an example, we need to change url in RestTemplate to call B when B deployed server as changed. 
* But using with Service Discovery, we don't need to change the url as we use Service Name instead of using ip:port address when A call to B.
* Also, Eureka provide for `Load Balancing` collaboration with Ribbon. <br>
It's mean, Service B might have many Instances (duplicate service) `for handling thousands requests`.
* Using Load Balancer, Service A don't need to add url for each Instance location and Load Balancer will auto route to Instance of Service B. <br>
In this Example, I dropped for Service B and Service B instance. It might have more than one Instance.
* The advantages of using Client Side Service Discovery is all Services need to add Eureka in application and <br> 
because if Service don't connect with Eureka, Eureka don't know the service location and can't connect to that service.
* In modern cloud based service deployment architecture, I `don't recommend` to use `Eureka` and use Server Side Discovery (same logic with Client Side Discovery) not for depending connecting to Discovery from each Service. <br>
Using Server Side Discovery, every Service don't need to add code logic for Load Balancing and Load Balance will serve as Separately. <br>
eg. Kubernetes orchestrate for each Container and involved Load Balancer as native.

Firstly, you should pull [Eureka Server](https://github.com/yewin-mm/spring-cloud-eureka-server) as for server and [Microservice b](https://github.com/yewin-mm/spring-cloud-eureka-sample-microservice-b) and [Microservice b Instance 2](https://github.com/yewin-mm/spring-cloud-eureka-sample-microservice-b-instance2) for testing.

<a name="prerequisites"></a>
### üîë Prerequisites
Prerequisites can be found here, [Spring Boot Application Instruction](https://github.com/yewin-mm/spring-boot-app-instruction). <br>
You need to clone and run [Eureka Server](https://github.com/yewin-mm/spring-cloud-eureka-server) first. <br>
You need to clone and run [Microservice b](https://github.com/yewin-mm/spring-cloud-eureka-sample-microservice-b) and [Microservice b Instance 2](https://github.com/yewin-mm/spring-cloud-eureka-sample-microservice-b-instance2).


<a name="instruction"></a>
### üìù Instruction

<a name="check-eureka-server"></a>
#### Checking Eureka Server Portal
* Clone and Run [Eureka Server](https://github.com/yewin-mm/spring-cloud-eureka-server) in your IDE.
* Call Eureka Server Portal `http://localhost:8761/` in browser. [Default Eureka Server Url](http://localhost:8761/).
* You can see `No Instances available` under `Application` tab under `Instances currently registered with Eureka` in `Eureka Server Portal`.
* Because you up your server and no instance (application) are connected (register) to this server right now.
* Clone this project and Run in your IDE.
* Refresh in your Eureka Server Portal.
  * There, you can see `SERVICE-A` under `Application` tab and `Up(1)` under Status.
  * There, `Up(1)` mean there has only one instance (one application) which registered in Eureka with name `SERVICE-A`. 
  * You can see follow by url after Up like `192.168.1.2:Service-A:8080`, and you can click that endpoint to see the `SERVICE-A` application `info` which provided by Spring boot `Actuator`.
  * You can also see other Services if you `run` [Microservice b](https://github.com/yewin-mm/spring-cloud-eureka-sample-microservice-b) and [Microservice b Instance 2](https://github.com/yewin-mm/spring-cloud-eureka-sample-microservice-b-instance2) at the same time.
  * After run these above Services, `refresh` eureka portal. But you can't see as two line for those `Service-B` and `Service-B Instance` because it used same Service Name when registered in Eureka server. It's mean you duplicate Service B for handling thousands requests.
  * So, for `Service-B`, you can see `Up(2)` because you run two applications with same Service Name.
  * If you down(stop) one service of `Service-B`, you can see `Down(1)` and `Up(1)` under `Status` tab.
  * So, you can test these three services by stopping, starting applications. And See the `Eureka Server Portal` by refreshing.
* You can also see `General Info` and `Instance Info` in Eureka Server Portal.

#### Testing

<a name="call-api-direct"></a>
##### Testing APIs by Direct
* Import `eureka-client.postman_collection.json` file under project directory (see that file in project directory) into your installed Postman application.
  * Click in your Postman (top left corner) import -> file -> upload files -> {choose that json file} and open/import.
  * After that, you can see the folder which you import from file in your Postman.
* Now, you can 'Test' normal APIs by calling from Postman.
  * Open your imported `eureka-client` folder in postman and inside this folder, you will see total of 3 Folder,
  * Open `service-a` folder
    * Open `serviceADemoAPI` api, click `send` button, you can see `Hello from Service A` Message and this message is from this `Service A`.
    * If not already run, Run [Microservice b](https://github.com/yewin-mm/spring-cloud-eureka-sample-microservice-b) and [Microservice b Instance 2](https://github.com/yewin-mm/spring-cloud-eureka-sample-microservice-b-instance2) applications.
    * Below are `direct API call` to `Service B` and `Service B Instance`.
    * Open `(direct call) call service-b api from service-a` api, click `send` button, you can see `Hello from Service B` message and this message is from `Service B`.
    * Open `(direct call) call service-b instance 2 api from service-a` api, click `send` button, you can see `Hello from Service B` message and this message is from `Service B Instance 2`.
  * You can see code in this project for Direct API Calling and this is under `callServiceBFromServiceADirectAPICall` method and `callServiceBInstanceFromServiceADirectAPICall` method of `ServiceATestService` class.  


<a name="call-api-eureka"></a>
##### Call APIs through Eureka
* I assumed that you already imported my postman collection as above [Call APIs by Direct](#call-api-direct) guide and already `Run` Service B and B Instance applications.
  * Open your imported `eureka-client` folder in postman and inside this folder, you will see total of 3 Folder,
  * Open `service-a` folder
    * Open `serviceADemoAPI` api, click `send` button, you can see `Hello from Service A` Message and this message is from this `Service A`.
    * If not already run, Run [Microservice b](https://github.com/yewin-mm/spring-cloud-eureka-sample-microservice-b) and [Microservice b Instance 2](https://github.com/yewin-mm/spring-cloud-eureka-sample-microservice-b-instance2) applications.
    * Open `(through eureka) call service-b api from service-a` api, click `send` button, 
    * You can see `Hello from Service B` message and this message can be from both `Service B` and `Service B Instance 2`.
    * You can check above message is from which service by checking in your IDE logs, check logs in both `Service B` and `Service B Instance 2` application console logs in your IDE. 
    * Call 4 or 5 times above `through eureka` api again and check logs in `Service B` and `B Instance` again.
    * You can see logs will output in both `Service B` and `B Instance` when these was called by `Service A`.
    * It's mean `Service -A` can call to both `Service B` and `B Instance` by using one URL as `Round Robin` rule of Load Balancer.
  
  * You can see code in this project for call API through Eureka and this is under `callServiceBFromServiceAThroughEureka` method of `ServiceATestService` class.
  * Surprisingly that `Service -A` used `only one` url which provided from `Eureka Server` to call `Service B` and `Service B instance`.
  * So, `Eureka` can provide url as `Service Name` which service (application) registered in `Eureka Server`.
  * That's what we call Service Discovery, and it's mean one service can discover easily other services if these all services registered in `Eureka Server`.

* Please note that there can have many service and each service has one or more instances.
  * Eg. `Service A` might have one or more instances.
  * `Service B` also might have another instance like Service B Instance 2.
  * There might have other services like `Service C`, etc... as per your microservices structure.
  * Service mean your application (microservice), and you can give the name as your want.
  * In real world application, we do separated many instances for one service because it can handle well `thousands requests`.

* That's what we call Service Discovery, 
  * it's mean one service can discover easily other services if these all services registered in `Eureka Server`.
  * Service Discovery will reduce coupling because we can easily migrate(change) our application deployed server, and we don't need to change url for that server from caller service.

* Also, You can call `(built-in api) info api (which provided from actuator)` and `(built-in api) health api (which provided from actuator)` APIs too which APIs are provided from Spring Boot Actuator and that's built-in APIs as I don't need to add manually for those APIs.

* After that you can check the code which you don't know. You can learn it, and you can apply in your job or study fields.
